## Assignment 3 SVG Graphic

## Struggles and obstacles/notes
Using the pen tool was difficult, so I opted for a simple design which involved six rectangles made
by the pen tool. I then used the union selection and made them three shapes. It is supposed to be like the 
guidance arrows found in racing games. I already filled the shapes in with figma, besides doing it in the css.
